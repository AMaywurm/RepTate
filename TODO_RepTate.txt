*(OK)menu to define the dataset style of symbols: empty/full, colour palette, shape, and size
->add possibility of colour gradient or seaborn colour palette

*(OK)handle the file units and reflect it on the figure x,y-labels. Use LaTex font?

*(done) move the limit buttons to the theory widget

*implement Materials Database (Me, Tg, tau_e, etc knowing the chemistry, see old delphi version of Reptate)

*table and plot operations (integral, arithmetic operations with columns, add two tables, etc.)

*should we care about applications that have more than one view simultaneously? Like React in the old Reptate.

*zoom in and out of the plot

Plot Area 
-----------------------

The plot area shows the graphical representation of the data files in the current Dataset (or all the Datasets in the current application, if the "View all Datasets simultaneously" button is clicked). Several operations can be done in the plot area:

- By clicking on a data point, a label is shown with  its (:math:`x`, :math:`y`) coordinates, with respect to the current View (label **1** in :numref:`figplotarea`). The label can be hidden by clicking on it again.
- By right-clicking on the plot area and dragging the mouse, the user can zoom to an specific region of the plot.
- By using the mouse wheel, the user can zoom in or out in the plot. 
- By right-clicking on the plot, a menu is shown with the following operations (label **3** in :numref:`figplotarea`):
    - The chart can be copied to the clipboard as an image. The image can be pasted on any other program (such as Microsoft Word or Powerpoint)
    - The chart can be saved to an image file, using different formats (png, pdf, etc).
    - An annotation label can be added to the plot (label **2** in :numref:`figplotarea`). LaTeX commands can be used in the text of the annotation. Annotation labels can be moved around by dragging them with the mouse and edited by double-clicking on them.
    - The view can be reset to the default zoom.
    - The view can be changed to any of the available views in the current application.

View selection 
-----------------------

The data read from the files can be represented in several different ways, which are different for each application. In RepTate, the way some experimental or theory data are represented is referred to as the **View**. 

There are two different ways to select a View:

- From the drop-down box at the top-right corner of the Application window. By clicking on the box, a menu is shown with all the Views that are defined in the current application. By hovering the mouse over the View names, some additional information may be displayed. 
- By right-clicking on the plot area, a menu is displayed. By selecting the submenu "Select View", the user can select the view from a list (the contents of the list are exactly the same as in the drop-down box). 

At the left of the drop-down box, there is a small up-down selector that allows the user to change the number of graphs that are shown in the plot area. When there are more than one graph, a small set of tabs is shown on the left of the Plot area (see :numref:`figmanyviews`). The number of tabs is equal to the number of Views + 1. The tab 0 shows all views and the other tabs show a single view.

Most Applications in RepTate show just one graph by default. 

The data, as represented by the current View/Views, can be saved to a text file by clicking on the button at the right of the View combo box.

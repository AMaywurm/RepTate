Install python
==============

Install python 3 in your computer. Any 64-bit distribution is fine. We recommend `miniconda 
<https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`_..

Windows
-------

After installing miniconda with Python 3.6, 64-bit, open a terminal and run::

    > conda install pyqt 
    > conda install -c unidata pint 
    > conda install matplotlib 
    > conda install scipy
    > conda install -c conda-forge tabulate 
    > conda install seaborn

If necessary, install the git CVS system. Then, clone the Reptate source code distribution from the `github <https://github.com/jorge-ramirez-upm/RepTate>`_.. site::

    > git clone https://github.com/jorge-ramirez-upm/RepTate.git

Alternatively, download the zip package containing the Reptate source code and uncompress it.    
After that, it should be possible to run Reptate in the Reptate folder with the command::

    > python Reptate.py
